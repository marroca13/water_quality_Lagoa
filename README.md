# Environmental Impact Assessment of Conceiçao Lagoon water quality after a massive wastewater discharge
Scripts of the work done to evaluate water quality impact in Conceiçao Lagoon (Brazil) after a massive wastewater discharge occurred in January 2021.

## Bayesian Dynamic Generalized Additive Model DGAM) - DGAM_R
Scripts in R to evaluate chlorophyll-a trends from in situ measurements
- functions.R
- DGAM.Rmd

## Sentinel-2 image processing in Jupyter Notebooks - Image_processing_Python
Workflow of image processing in Python. Scripts:
- ODW mask and dynamic Otsu threshold to eliminate land pixels
- Time series analysis of water quality variables
- Match-up analysis of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a and in situ samples

    Graph creation in R:
  - Match-up graph
  - Monthly/year distribution of images used

## Data
- 5 satellite-derived water quality variables
- precipitation data
- in situ chlorophyll-a data
